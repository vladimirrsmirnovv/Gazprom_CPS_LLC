# GAZPROM_Gazprom_CPS_LLC
One of the most challenging projects I implemented was an empirical study during my internship at Gazprom CPS LLC as part of a welding production digitalization program. I developed a project’s pipeline, conducted EDA, and analyzed technological parameters' impact. The results led to recommendations for process optimization.
